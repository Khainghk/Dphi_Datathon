# Patient Survival Prediction
This project is a part of the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/patient-survival-after-one-year-of-treatment).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to get basic insights of data cleaning, data visualization and machine learning model development.


### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning

### Technologies
* Python
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Pandas, jupyter
* Scikit-Learn 

## Project Description
A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.
You are the best data scientist in Greenland and they've hired you to solve this problem. Now you are responsible for developing a model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://github.com/Khainghk/Patient-Survival-Prediction-After-1Year.git)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/Khainghk/Patient-Survival-Prediction-After-1Year.git)
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/Khainghk/Patient-Survival-Prediction-After-1Year.git)
